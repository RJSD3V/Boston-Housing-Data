# Boston Housing DataSet.
I have made an attempt to use some data science principles and study The Boston Housing data-set to summarize it and use some exploratory 
Data analysis techniques in pandas and python to sort of select features and identify the correlations between the dependent and independant features to see what factors cause a rise or decline in property prices, across several towns (data points) in boston.
