# Boston Housing DataSet.
I have made an attempt to use some data science principles and study The Boston Housing data-set to summarize it and use some exploratory 
Data analysis techniques in pandas and python to sort of select features and identify the correlations between the dependent and independant features to see what factors cause a rise or decline in property prices, across several towns (data points) in boston.

First we import all the packages that we need, like pandas (Data Processing) , numpy, sklearn and matplotlib. You can use seaborn for additional stuff, like making correlation matrices, drawing multiple plots using the subplot() function, Ive used seaborn here for fair exploratory uses.
